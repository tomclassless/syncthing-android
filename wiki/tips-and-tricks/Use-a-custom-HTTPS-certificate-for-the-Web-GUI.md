### Use your own HTTPS certificate for the Web GUI

By default, Syncthing creates its own **self-signed** certificate for the local Web GUI / API, and
the app trusts exactly that certificate. If you'd rather use a certificate signed by your own
Certificate Authority (CA) — for example one issued by a private CA such as
[Smallstep](https://smallstep.com/), an internal company CA, or a public CA — you can replace the
built-in certificate and the app will still be able to talk to Syncthing.

This is an advanced, optional setup. The default self-signed certificate is perfectly secure for
local use, so only do this if you specifically need a CA-signed certificate.

---

### Before you start

You will need:

1. **A certificate and its private key** for the Syncthing Web GUI, in PEM format. The private key
   must be **unencrypted** — Syncthing cannot read a password-protected key, and the app will refuse
   one rather than let you apply it. If yours is encrypted, decrypt it first:

   ```
   openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in encrypted-key.pem -out https-key.pem
   ```
2. **The full certificate chain** in the certificate file. The file must contain your server
   (leaf) certificate **followed by any intermediate certificate(s)**, in order. If you only put
   the leaf certificate in the file, the app (and browsers) can't link it back to your root CA and
   the connection will be rejected.
3. **Your root CA installed and trusted on the phone.** Install the root CA under
   *Android Settings → Security → Encryption & credentials → Install a certificate → CA certificate*
   (the exact path varies by device). After installing, it appears under your phone's
   **user-trusted** certificates. The app trusts both the built-in system CAs and the CAs **you**
   install here.

> The hostname in the certificate does **not** matter. The app always connects to your local
> Syncthing on the loopback address (`127.0.0.1`), and it does not require the certificate to be
> issued for `127.0.0.1`. (If you also use Syncthing's "Remote access" feature from other devices,
> add the relevant hostnames/IPs to the certificate's SAN for those devices — that is independent
> of the app on the phone.)

### Method A — in the app (recommended)

The app has a built-in screen that validates your certificate before applying it and restarts
Syncthing for you, rolling back automatically if anything goes wrong.

1. Install your **root CA** on the phone if you haven't already (see *Before you start*, step 3).
2. In the app, go to **Settings → Syncthing Options → Web GUI → Custom HTTPS certificate**.
3. Tap **Select certificate (.pem)** and choose your certificate file (leaf + full chain), then
   **Select private key (.pem)** and choose the matching key. (If you pick them in the wrong order,
   the app sorts it out automatically.)
4. Review the validation checklist:
   - **Certificate chain** — is the full chain present?
   - **Trusted by this device** — will the app accept it? (self-signed, or chains to a CA your
     device trusts)
   - **Validity period** — not expired / not yet valid.
   - **Private key** — does the key match the certificate?
5. Tap **Apply certificate**. Syncthing restarts with the new certificate, and the app then confirms
   that the certificate actually in use is the one you supplied. If Syncthing didn't come back
   online, or it rejected the certificate and generated its own instead, the previous certificate is
   restored automatically and the reason stays on screen with a link to this page.

To go back to the default, use **Reset to auto-generated certificate** on the same screen — Syncthing
creates a fresh self-signed certificate.

> This screen only appears when the Web UI is served over HTTPS (it is on all modern Android
> versions).

### Method B — manually via config export/import

Use this if you prefer editing files directly.

1. In the app, go to **Settings → Import and Export** and **export** your configuration. This
   creates `config.zip` (by default at
   `/storage/emulated/0/backups/syncthing/config.zip`). See also
   [How can I access the config and key files?](Access-Syncthing-config-and-key-files.md).
2. Open `config.zip` and replace these two files with your own:
   - `https-cert.pem` — your certificate **including the full chain** (leaf + intermediate(s)).
   - `https-key.pem` — the matching **private key**.

   Leave everything else (`config.xml`, `cert.pem`, `key.pem`, the database, etc.) unchanged.
3. Put the updated files back into `config.zip` (keep the same file names and the same archive
   layout), and copy it back to the export location.
4. Install your **root CA** on the phone if you haven't already (see *Before you start*, step 3).
5. In the app, go to **Settings → Import and Export** and **import** the configuration.
6. Start/restart Syncthing. The app should now connect normally, and the local Web GUI should open
   using your certificate.

### If the app can't connect after the change

If Syncthing is clearly running and syncing, you can open the Web GUI in a normal browser, but the
**app itself** never finishes loading (it shows your folders/devices but stays stuck, or the API
seems unreachable), check the following — almost always it's one of these:

- **The root CA isn't installed (or got removed) on the phone.** Re-check
  *Settings → Security → … → Trusted credentials → User*. Without it, the app cannot verify your
  certificate.
- **The certificate file is missing the chain.** `https-cert.pem` must contain the intermediate
  certificate(s) after the leaf, not just the leaf on its own.
- **The wrong key was used.** `https-key.pem` must be the private key that matches the leaf
  certificate in `https-cert.pem`.
- **The key is encrypted.** Syncthing cannot read a password-protected key. Note what it does in that
  case: rather than failing, it quietly generates a *new self-signed* certificate and starts with
  that, so the Web GUI keeps working and your certificate is simply gone. Method A detects this and
  puts your previous certificate back; with Method B there is nothing to warn you.
- **The archive layout changed.** When repacking `config.zip`, keep the original file names and
  structure so the import recognizes the files.

A log line containing `BAD_SIGNATURE` during startup is the classic symptom of a missing/untrusted
root CA or an incomplete chain.

Method A (the in-app screen) catches the first three of these before applying and won't let you
apply a certificate the app wouldn't be able to trust, so it's the easier path if you're unsure.

### Good to know (security & privacy)

- The app only ever talks to the Syncthing instance **on the same phone**, over the loopback
  interface (`127.0.0.1`). Your API key and configuration never leave the device for these calls,
  even if you enable "Remote access".
- The app first checks for Syncthing's built-in self-signed certificate. Only if that doesn't match
  does it fall back to the certificates trusted by Android — including the CA **you** installed.
  This keeps the default setup unchanged for everyone who doesn't use a custom certificate.
- Trusting your installed CA for the app is scoped to the **local** connection only; it does not
  change how Syncthing verifies the other devices you sync with (that uses Syncthing's own
  device-ID-based security and is unaffected).
- Reverting is easy: use **Reset to auto-generated certificate** (Method A), import an unmodified
  `config.zip`, and the app goes back to the default self-signed certificate.
